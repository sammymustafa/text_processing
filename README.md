# Prediciting Medical Abstract Classes
#### LING 331 Final

Utilized over 30,000 medical abstracts to teach and test a preliminary machine learning model how to differentiate between abstracts of different conditions: neoplasms (1), digestive system diseases (2), nervous system diseases (3), cardiovascular diseases (4), and general pathological conditions (5). Very promising and interesting realm of data science to branch into!!! Wooo NLP!!

I recommend previewing the HTML file ([here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/sammymustafa/text_processing/blob/main/final.html)) to have a comprehensive view of the introduction to the data and process, steps getting there, and analysis.
